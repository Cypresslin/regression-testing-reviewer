3.2.0-142.189 - generic
Regression test CMPL, RTB.

33 / 34 tests were run, missing: ubuntu_boot
Issue to note in amd64:
  ubuntu_cts_kernel - perf with redirection issue (bug 1801877)

32 / 33 tests were run, missing: ubuntu_boot
Issue to note in i386:
  ubuntu_cts_kernel - perf with redirection issue (bug 1801877)
  ubuntu_qrt_kernel_security - CONFIG_X86_PAE (bug 1837965)

The ubuntu_qrt_kernel_security for i386 is a new test, so I don't think this is a regression
