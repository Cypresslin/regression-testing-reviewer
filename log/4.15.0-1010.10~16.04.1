4.15.0-1010.10~16.04.1 - gcp
Regression test CMPL, RTB.

Issue to note in gcp:
  libhugetlbfs - 1 failed , 1 killed by signal, 3 bad config
  ubuntu_kvm_unit_tests - failed due to no KVM support
  ubuntu_ltp_syscalls - inotify08 failed with X/X-LTS/X-HWE/A/B kernel (bug 1775784)
  ubuntu_lttng_smoke_test - lttng module failed to build (bug 1779114)
  ubuntu_quota_smoke_test - need the -extra package (bug 1777114)
  ubuntu_unionmount_overlayfs_suite	- File unexpectedly on union layer (bug 1751243)

Skipped / blacklisted:
 * ubuntu_ltp
 * ubuntu_nbd_smoke_test
 * ubuntu_seccomp
 * ubuntu_sysdig_smoke_test
 * ubuntu_zram_smoke_test

Note that the lttng module build issue is a new one. Considering it's just a DKMS issue I will not consider it as a regression.
